Research reveals that there will always be a need for better optimization algorithms to solve real life NP-hard problems, since the complexity of these problems is ever increasing. With the advancement of evolutionary algorithm (EA) research, new alternative model must be developed to tackle this ever increasing complexity. In this project, we attempt to solve a multiple objective optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization that combines a deterministic pre-processing component with the EA. This deterministic component will act as a global explorer which reduced the chance of stuck to the local optima and generate highly potential candidate solutions. Blending this component mainly to tackle a common   problem “searching around non-feasible solutions” of most non-deterministic algorithms. In most evolutionary algorithms (EA), naturally fittest candidate acts (partially or totally) as an exemplar (guide). Where in this proposed model, naturally generated fittest candidate selected as a learner only (as opposed to EAs) in the deterministic part. The fundamental aim is that significant amount deterministic activities plus small amount stochastic activities result to a new efficient evolutionary algorithm. In deterministic part, a learning mechanism called collective learning (CL) used effectively by naturally fittest one, to acquire all goodness of common candidates solutions.

To build a smart and portable Air Quality \& Sound Monitoring System integrated with multiple sensors connected in a network capable of detecting the concentration level of multiple air pollutants and also intensity of sound, for indoor and outdoor environments. The AQI(Air Quality Index) of a particular area or locality could be determined by measuring the pollutants present in vicinity. Similarly, Noise pollution could be detected by measuring the intensity of the sound. The objective of designing a project that monitors the levels of air pollution is to inform us about the critical levels of air pollutants in real-time with the help of a real-time monitoring website and an android application so that it is possible to take proper precautions and safeguard ourselves from the harmful effects of pollution. The website will give the exact locations of all the devices placed in a map and will represent whether the concentration of the pollutants is under the prescribed limit with the help of different colour scales representing AQI levels. The android application will also enhance the same functionality by having provision to set personalized profile of the users enabling them to get notification when they are exposed to some contaminant higher than the individual prescribed limit according to their health condition.

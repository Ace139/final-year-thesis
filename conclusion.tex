\chapter{Conclusion}
In the proposed system, a heterogeneous ultrasonic sensor grid is used for detecting different human activities. ClassiÔ¨Åcation analysis has been performed on the collected data set for detecting different activities using various machine learning algorithms considering the number of sensors used and the reduced feature set.\\ The system has achieved a high activity detection accuracy rate more than 90\% in laboratory setting. However, this system has extensive application possibilities beyond the laboratory for monitoring of human activity in hospital, workplace, and home environments

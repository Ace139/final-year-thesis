\chapter{Conclusion}
In the course of this project we were successfully able to  build a smart and portable Air Quality \& Sound Monitoring System integrated with multiple sensors connected in a network capable of detecting the concentration level of multiple air pollutants and also intensity of sound, for indoor and outdoor environments. We started with low quality sensors and  gradually moved to High quality sensors for better stability, precision and reliability. We made the AQM unit robust and portable enough to be used both in Indoor and Outdoor conditions providing reliable data. To get real-time data from devices placed in different locations, we also developed a website as well as an Android Application for portable usage. In our experiments in classroom environment we were able to find relationship between the number of students taking the class and concentrations of Pollutants to find the acceptable duration of the class. The work \cite{31} was  published in \textit{9TH International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks(COMSNETS 2017)}.

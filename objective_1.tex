To build a smart integrated air quality monitoring system with multi-air pollutants sensor network for indoor and outdoor environment. The level of pollution in air can be measured by measuring the pollutants present in the air of that area. The objective of designing a project that monitors air pollution is to prevent the harmful eﬀects of pollutants present in air with the help of a real time monitoring website as well as with android app so that healthy surroundings can be maintained. The website will give the exact location of all the devices placed in a google map and will represent whether the concentration of the pollutants is under the prescribed limit with the help of colours representing diﬀerent AQI levels. Android app will also enhance the same representation by having proﬁles, where user can create proﬁle depending on their health proﬁle and they will get notiﬁcations and health status depending on the same.
